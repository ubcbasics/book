# Complimentary Programs
This is a non-exhaustive list of major and minor honours programs available to B.A. students which may pair well with a Computer Science major. Unlike the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Arts allows students to enrol in a second (double) major without any faculty-level approval.

## Warning for the Data Science Minor
**It is not recommended to pursue the minor in Data Science if pursuing a major in Computer Science.** The program has one prerequisite course, DSCI_V 100. Admissions to the minor are currently based on a lottery system,[^1] randomly selecting students rather than considering academic performance. **Applying to the minor is literally gambling with your tuition.** If not accepted, DSCI_V 100 will be considered a non-Arts elective credit and thus will not be counted towards your degree. See the [Arts credit guide](../credit.md) for more details.

## Applied Music Technology (Minor)
> The Applied Music Technology minor offers training in technology for music composition, performance and software programming, as well as knowledge about interactive video manipulation and art installations.

Note that 6 credits of 300/400 level CPSC_V may be double-counted towards both the major in Computer Science and minor in Applied Music Technology with the approval of the program coordinator.[^2]

## Informatics (Minor)
> Informatics, or information science, is a field of study focused on the use of information, data and knowledge in society and across academic disciplines. It considers how information is produced, stored, organized, classified, disseminated and preserved. It also analyzes how technical and social information systems function and the role that information systems play in the lives of individuals, communities, and our global ecosystem.

## Linguistics (Major/Minor)
> Linguistics is a highly interdisciplinary field which combines research methods from the humanities and the social, natural, and mathematical sciences to study human language and offers a systematic study of how language works. Linguists work on sound systems (phonetics and phonology), on the relation between form and meaning (morphology, syntax, and semantics), and on how languages change over time.

Note that specific CPSC_V courses may be double-counted towards both the major in Computer Science and major/minor in Linguistics.[^3]

## Mathematics (Major/Minor)
> Mathematics is viewed across academic disciplines as a valuable training ground for critical thinking and problem solving, and a fundamental component of computational and data literacy. Mathematics at UBC provides an excellent balance of pure and applied mathematics.

Admission to the major is a determined by academic performance, so MATH_V 220 may be left as a non-Arts elective if not accepted into the program. However, if already accepted into the major in Computer Science, your academic performance is likely strong enough to mitigate this risk. Note that specific CPSC_V courses may be double-counted towards both the major in Computer Science and major in Mathematics.
