# Gateway Programs
The Faculty of Arts offers two "gateway programs" designed to introduce first-year students to the university by providing them with a pre-made course schedule and a small cohort of peers. Arts One is a single 2-term course combining multiple subjects together with a team of lecturers and an integrated syllabus. The Coordinated Arts Program is more flexible, made up of multiple different "streams" comprised of normal 100-level UBC courses with dedicated sections for CAP students. Both programs are viable options for students intending to major in Computer Science.

## Registration
Both Arts One and CAP earn students 18 credits[^1][^2], leaving exactly 12 credits in the 30 credit limit[^3] for CPSC_V 110, CPSC_V 121, and CPSC_V 210. However, the credit limit is typically distributed evenly for 15 credits per term, and CAP and Arts One also distribute their credits evenly for 9 credits per term, leaving 6 credits per term free for electives. This is not compatible with the required CPSC_V courses, as taking CPSC_V 121 at the same time as CPSC_V 110 or CPSC_V 210 will require 8 credits of elective space to register. This can be remedied by submitting a [credit load adjustment request](https://students.air.arts.ubc.ca/credit-load-adjustment-request/) to re-balance exactly 2 credits over to the term in which you will take CPSC_V 121.

For example, a student who intends to take CPSC_V 110 and CPSC_V 121 in their first term will need to enrol in 17 credits in that term (9 gateway credits + 8 CPSC_V credits), which Workday will not allow. In their second term they only need to enrol in 13 credits (9 gateway credits + 4 credits for CPSC_V 210), so those 2 credits can be re-balanced to their first term by submitting a credit load adjustment request.

## Parallel Planning
Arts One grants students 6 credits of PHIL_V[^1], leaving them automatically eligible to apply for Cognitive Systems if taking the required CPSC_V courses. Credits earned in CAP depend on the stream enrolled in. In order to be eligible for Cognitive Systems, students in CAP must enrol in a stream which includes at least 1 PHIL_V, PSYC_V, or LING_V course. See the [parallel planning guide](parallel-planning.md) for more details.
