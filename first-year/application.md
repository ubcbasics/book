# Application
Application to the Major in Computer Science requires that students have successfully completed CPSC_V 110, CPSC_V 121, and CPSC_V 210, and completed 27 credits in total.[^1] These requirements may be in progress at the time of application. It is highly recommended to apply at the end of your first year. It is possible to re-apply in subsequent years if not accepted in your first application.

## What about MATH_V 100 or 101?
While listed as lower-level requirements, the MATH_V courses are not required to apply. It is encouraged to take them if you consider mathematics to be an academic strong suit, or if they are required for a secondary program you are pursuing, but there is no penalty for taking these courses in your second year.

## What about the Writing Requirement?
The Writing Requirement is only required to be completed before 54 credits are earned.[^2] Although recommended by the Faculty of Arts to complete within your first year, there is no penalty if taken in the first term of your second year. It is recommended to complete a writing course if you consider it to be an academic strong suit.

## What about the Ways of Knowing Breadth requirement?
The Ways of Knowing Breadth requirement is designed to be incrementally completed throughout the duration of your degree, and there is no requirement or expectation to make any progress towards it in your first year.
