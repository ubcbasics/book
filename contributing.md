# Fix This Book!
As a student-run resource, this handbook accepts additions and edits from students as information is updated in order to maintain accuracy. Each page is written in basic Markdown and hosted on GitHub. To submit an edit, simply open a pull request on the repository.

We require that all newly submitted information contains a footnote linking to an official source within the university. As per the other footnotes scattered throughout this book, all footnotes must contain an archived version of the resource and the original date of access. Any pull requests submitted without proper attributions will not be merged.
