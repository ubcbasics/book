# Academic Advising
## Arts Academic Advising
The Faculty of Arts offers asynchronous advising by email at arts.advisor@ubc.ca or through an [advising request web-form](https://students.air.arts.ubc.ca/contact-arts-academic-advising/) - this is not the recommended option for students in need of information under a tight deadline, as responses by email have historically taken up to several months.

The fastest way to contact the Faculty is through drop-in advising. Drop-in advising is available every weekday from 1 P.M. to 4 P.M. in Brock Commons South room 2060, excluding Fridays where all drop-in advising is held online. Drop-in advising uses [an online queue](https://vue.comm100.com/joinqueue/75000257/location?locationId=59fa1343d06d4f808180d6ea31d88487) which is typically set to automatically open at exactly 12:46 P.M. The queue is set to automatically close after reaching capacity so it is recommended to join as soon as possible.

If your advising request is related to credit counting, such as for the Arts/outside requirement, we highly recommended requesting to speak to an "Academic Systems" advisor. This is because not all staff members of Arts Advising specialize in degree regulations. If coming for a drop-in appointment, after checking in at the front desk you can request to be put with an advisor in Academic Systems.

## Computer Science Undergradute Advising
The Department of Computer Science offers asynchronous advising by email at undergrad-info@cs.ubc.ca or through an [advising request web-form](https://my.cs.ubc.ca/form/request-advising) - this is not the recommended option for students in need of information under a tight deadline, as responses by email have historically taken up to a month.

The fastest way to contact the department is through online drop-in advising. Drop-in advising is available on Mondays and Wednesdays from 11 A.M. to 12 P.M., and on Fridays from 10 A.M. to 11 A.M. Advising takes place in a [dedicated Zoom meeting room](https://ubc.zoom.us/j/6763530441?pwd=z5NRbsYlYW6VaaSVhraY9k4a6EyjcG.1&omn=62788109456).
