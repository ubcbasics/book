# Ways of Knowing Breadth
The [Ways of Knowing Breadth](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/ways-of-knowing-breadth-explorer/) requirement encourages B.A. students to study in multiple different areas of the Faculty within their degree. In Computer Science, the "Natural & Physical Science" breadth category is covered by your CPSC_V courses. To complete the requirement, you must take 9, 6, and 3 credits of Social & Behavioural Systems, Humanities & Creative Arts, and Language as Meaning in any configuration.[^1] Several of the courses in the [awesome electives page](../electives.md) are sequences which naturally fulfill one category of this requirement. For example, LING_V 142, 242, and 342 are a progression through computational linguistics which can fulfill the Social & Behavioural Systems with 9 credits. Progress towards the Ways of Knowing Breadth requirement will not be shown on Workday due to the flexibility of the requirement, and will only be confirmed by the Faculty of Arts upon application for graduation. Contacting [academic advising](../advising.md) to resolve any confusion over which courses apply to this requirement as soon as possible is encouraged.
