# Co-op
UBC Co-op allows students to incorporate full-time work placements into their studies. B.A. CS students are eligible for both Arts Co-op and Science Co-op.[^1][^2] Note that unlike Science Co-op, students in Arts Co-op enter a general pool of Arts students and do not get access to support or job listings specific to Computer Science students[^3], so it is not the recommended option. Note that credits earned with either co-op program are non-academic credits, and as such they will not apply towards any degree requirements whatsoever.

## Science Co-op
Within Science Co-op, B.A. students are given equal access to postings available to Science students and a dedicated advisor. [Eligibility conditions](https://sciencecoop.ubc.ca/prospective/apply/cs) apply and admissions are determined by an application. Students are encouraged to apply starting in their second year and are recommended to follow one of the 2 following schedules:[^1]
