B.A. CS Handbook\nWelcome! This handbook aims to be complimentary material to the UBC Academic Calendar for students at any point in their Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science at UBC Vancouver. This book aims to give peer insights on how to smoothly complete a fun and educational degree by clarifying policies, recommending options, and publishing information which would otherwise not be posted by the Faculty or Department.\nThis book is a project of UBC BASICS, the student group for B. A. Students In CS. It is not official documentation from the Faculty of Arts or Department of Computer Science. However, all content in this book is sourced from official UBC sources or written in consultation with undergraduate advising staff members - we aim to support all claims with a footnote linking directly to the source material. It is heavily encouraged to verify claims in this book before planning your degree around them, as misinterpretations or changes in information are possible, but our intention is to ideally save students from most trips to academic advising offices and point out nuances which students may need to pay special attention to.\nNotice anything off? This book is open source! Please read the \"Fix This Book!\" guide to submit a pull request with the needed edits.\n"},"credit.html":{"url":"credit.html","title":"Arts/Outside Credit","keywords":"","body":"Arts/Outside Credit\nThis is the most important page in this book. Please be sure to read it thoroughly before enrolling for any courses. Note that cited sources are limited as the content of his page has instead been manually discussed with multiple members of Arts Advising for accuracy.\nAt UBC, the credits you earn are tied to a specific faculty. Typically in a Bachelor of Arts, at least 72 of your 120 credits must be earned in the Faculty of Arts.1 This is the \"Arts credit minimum requirement.\" This requirement is not compatible with the Major in Computer Science, as it requires students to take 63 credits outside of Arts2 - your CPSC_V, MATH_V, and/or STAT_V courses. To account for this, Computer Science students are automatically granted a relaxation of the requirement to only 57 Arts credits with the following note attached:\n\n\"Note that students granted a relaxation of this requirement must complete the maximum number of Arts credits possible within the degree’s 120 credit total and no non-Arts elective credit will be permitted.\"1\n\nSimilarly, the \"Outside Requirement\" typically specifies that students must earn at least 60 of their 120 credits outside their major field of study. Because the 63 required CPSC_V, MATH_V, and/or STAT_V credits are considered to be within your field of study, you are also granted a relaxation of this requirement to 57 outside credits.\nIn order to complete your degree in 120 credits:\n\nDo not take any non-Arts courses except those specifically required for your major.\nDo not take any courses with Credit/D/Fail grading. This is because CR/D/F credits are not applicable towards the Outside Requirement.\n\nIf this advice is ignored, those credits earned will be added on top of your required credits, not subtracted from them. It is fully allowed to take more than 120 credits in your degree, but keep in mind the following consequences:\n\nYou will pay more tuition than necessary.\nYou will complete more coursework than necessary.\nIn order to fit the extra credits into your schedule, you may need to...\n...extend your degree by an additional year.\n...take summer courses.\n...take more than 5 courses in a single term.\n\n\n\nWhich credits are Arts credits?\nFor B.A. students, a course is deemed to carry Arts credits if the offering department/school is housed by the Faculty of Arts. To check, search the course code on the Academic Calendar. \"Faculty of Arts\" should display next to the subject name, like \"Psychology, Faculty of Arts.\" Note that despite displaying \"Faculty of Science,\" COGS_V courses carry Arts credits for B.A. students. Also note that despite mentions of Science credit on the course homepages, all PSYC_V and GEOS_V courses carry Arts credits for B.A. students.\nWhat about transfer credit?\nTransfer credits will only be applied towards your degree if they are either Arts credits or they directly map to a Computer Science major requirement. For example, AP and IB Computer Science courses grant generic 100-level CPSC_V credit rather than credit for CPSC_V 110 or CPSC_V 121, so they are considered to be electives and do not count towards any of your major, Arts, or Outside credit requirements. However, if a student on a Go Global exchange term transfers back 3 generic 300-level CPSC_V credits, they will directly count towards the upper-level Computer Science requirement so long as it has not already been fulfilled.\nWhat about MATH_V 110 or CPSC_V 103/107?\nThe Arts and Outside credit requirements will be relaxed further if a student takes MATH_V 110 over MATH_V 100/180 or CPSC_V 103 and CPSC_V 107 over CPSC_V 110 to account for the additional Science credits. In order for this relaxation to display on Workday, a request may need to be submitted to Arts Academic Advising.\n\n1.

In other words, key_avg = min(GPA + 0.05, CPSC_AVG). There is no other metric used to determine admissions. Domestic and international students are considered in the same pool. There are no specially dropped grades. Dropped courses, including those resulting in a W on your transcript, do not have any effect. If applying after your first year, your key average includes all courses taken at UBC over the past 2 winter sessions and the 1 summer session in-between. After applications are received, the key averages are calculated for all eligible students and the top 40 students are admitted. In addition to those 40, students may be specially considered if they submit documentation of extenuating circumstances which affected their academic functions, such as medical conditions.

Arts One is a single 2-term course combining multiple subjects together with a team of lecturers and an integrated syllabus. The Coordinated Arts Program is more flexible, made up of multiple different \"streams\" comprised of normal 100-level UBC courses with dedicated sections for CAP students. Both programs are viable options for students intending to major in Computer Science.\nRegistration\nBoth Arts One and CAP earn students 18 credits12, leaving exactly 12 credits in the 30 credit limit3 for CPSC_V 110, CPSC_V 121, and CPSC_V 210. However, the credit limit is typically distributed evenly for 15 credits per term, and CAP and Arts One also distribute their credits evenly for 9 credits per term, leaving 6 credits per term free for electives. This is not compatible with the required CPSC_V courses, as taking CPSC_V 121 at the same time as CPSC_V 110 or CPSC_V 210 will require 8 credits of elective space to register. This can be remedied by submitting a credit load adjustment request to re-balance exactly 2 credits over to the term in which you will take CPSC_V 121.\nFor example, a student who intends to take CPSC_V 110 and CPSC_V 121 in their first term will need to enrol in 17 credits in that term (9 gateway credits + 8 CPSC_V credits), which Workday will not allow. In their second term they only need to enrol in 13 credits (9 gateway credits + 4 credits for CPSC_V 210), so those 2 credits can be re-balanced to their first term by submitting a credit load adjustment request.\nParallel Planning\nArts One grants students 6 credits of PHIL_V1, leaving them automatically eligible to apply for Cognitive Systems if taking the required CPSC_V courses. Credits earned in CAP depend on the stream enrolled in. In order to be eligible for Cognitive Systems, students in CAP must enrol in a stream which includes at least 1 PHIL_V, PSYC_V, or LING_V course. See the parallel planning guide for more details.\n\n1. Registration | Program | Arts One | University of British Columbia, as of November 20 2025 ↩\n\n\n2.

This may be a challenge for Computer Science students as the number of comparable programs are notably limited within Arts.\nCognitive Systems\nThe Cognitive Systems major involves the study of natural and artificial intelligent systems across Computer Science, Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology courses. As described on the program's website, \"it emphasizes the study of existing systems (e.g., perception; language), the development of new ones (e.g., robotic agents; computational models), and the design of interfaces between different forms of intelligent agents (e.g., user experience, human-computer interaction).\" Cognitive Systems is not a drop-in replacement for Computer Science. Integration of Computer Science courses is extremely limited for Arts students, the core curriculum is focused on developing a different skillset, and students are not eligible for Computer Science Co-op. However, many students in Cognitive Systems follow similar career paths to Computer Science students.1\nEligibility to apply requires 2nd year standing and at least 9 credits across at least 2 of CPSC_V, PHIL_V, PSYC_V, LING_V, and COGS_V.2 For prospective B.A. CS students, the CPSC_V requirements can apply towards this requirement, and thus you must only take 3 credits of PHIL_V, PSYC_V, LING_V, or COGS_V in order to parallel plan for Cognitive Systems. Entrance to Cognitive Systems is based on an application, with 80% of their seats allocated to students based purely on normal GPA. For students with more than 27 credits, up to 12 of your lowest credits may be excluded from their calculations so long as those credits were not earned in any of the Cognitive Systems fields (or STAT_V). The remaining 20% of Cognitive Systems seats are allocated to students with consideration of academic performance, a resume/CV, and a short personal statement.3\nStudents can apply to both Computer Science and Cognitive Systems at the same time during April. Upon admission to Cognitive Systems, students are given a choice to accept their offer, which they may choose to decline upon notification of admission to Computer Science in order to free their seat for another applicant. There are currently 60 seats allocated to Arts students, with no distinction made between domestic or international applicants. The minimum accepted GPA per year is traditionally lower than Computer Science, only recommending students to submit a resume/CV and personal statement with GPAs of 80% and below.4\n\n1.

Unlike the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Arts allows students to enrol in a second (double) major without any faculty-level approval.\nWarning for the Data Science Minor\nIt is not recommended to pursue the minor in Data Science if pursuing a major in Computer Science. The program has one prerequisite course, DSCI_V 100. Admissions to the minor are currently based on a lottery system,1 randomly selecting students rather than considering academic performance. Applying to the minor is literally gambling with your tuition. If not accepted, DSCI_V 100 will be considered a non-Arts elective credit and thus will not be counted towards your degree. See the Arts credit guide for more details.\nApplied Music Technology (Minor)\n\nThe Applied Music Technology minor offers training in technology for music composition, performance and software programming, as well as knowledge about interactive video manipulation and art installations.\n\nNote that 6 credits of 300/400 level CPSC_V may be double-counted towards both the major in Computer Science and minor in Applied Music Technology with the approval of the program coordinator.2\nInformatics (Minor)\n\nInformatics, or information science, is a field of study focused on the use of information, data and knowledge in society and across academic disciplines. It considers how information is produced, stored, organized, classified, disseminated and preserved. It also analyzes how technical and social information systems function and the role that information systems play in the lives of individuals, communities, and our global ecosystem.\n\nLinguistics (Major/Minor)\n\nLinguistics is a highly interdisciplinary field which combines research methods from the humanities and the social, natural, and mathematical sciences to study human language and offers a systematic study of how language works. Linguists work on sound systems (phonetics and phonology), on the relation between form and meaning (morphology, syntax, and semantics), and on how languages change over time.\n\nNote that specific CPSC_V courses may be double-counted towards both the major in Computer Science and major/minor in Linguistics.3\nMathematics (Major/Minor)\n\nMathematics is viewed across academic disciplines as a valuable training ground for critical thinking and problem solving, and a fundamental component of computational and data literacy. Mathematics at UBC provides an excellent balance of pure and applied mathematics.\n\nAdmission to the major is a determined by academic performance, so MATH_V 220 may be left as a non-Arts elective if not accepted into the program. However, if already accepted into the major in Computer Science, your academic performance is likely strong enough to mitigate this risk. Note that specific CPSC_V courses may be double-counted towards both the major in Computer Science and major in Mathematics.\n\n1. Missing source. ↩\n\n\n2.
