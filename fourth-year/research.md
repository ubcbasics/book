# Research Requirement
The Research Component of the Writing and Research Requirement requires that all students complete a research-intensive experience specified for their major at any point prior to their graduation.[^1] To fulfill the requirement, Computer Science students may choose from one of the following options:
- CPSC_V 319 - Software Engineering Project (4 credits)
  - Students work on a large software engineering project in a group setting over 1 term, solving a real-world problem for an industry sponsor. Previous sponsors have included AWS, PwC, and HSBC.[^2]
- CPSC_V 448 - Directed Studies in Computer Science (3 or 6 credits)
  - Students propose a research topic in Computer Science to a Faculty member who will supervise their work, typically realized in a research paper by the end of the term.[^3] Credit weight is determined by the scale and depth of the study which can extend the course to 2 terms.
- CPSC_V 449 - Honours Thesis (6 credits)
  - See [the Honours page](../second-year/honours.md) for details.
- CPSC_V 491 - Interactive Digital Media Practicum (6 credits)
  - Students join a team of Master in Digital Media students and spend 20 hours a week over 1 term working on a real industry-sponsored interactive media design project. Hosted at the campus of the Centre for Digital Media, a joint venture of UBC, SFU, ECU, and BCIT.[^4]
- CPSC_V 410 - Advanced Software Engineering (3 credits)
- CPSC_V 444 - Advanced Methods for Human Computer Interaction (3 credits)
