# Graduation
Students in the last term of their degrees can apply for graduation beginning in January for the spring graduation period and late August for the fall graduation period.[^1] UBC typically schedules their graduation ceremonies such that all B.A. Computer Science students are placed in the same session, so you will graduate alongside your cohort.[^2] Prior to applying for graduation, it is highly encouraged to verify your eligibility earlier in the year. Students may request a [graduation check](https://students.air.arts.ubc.ca/graduation-check-request/) from Arts Advising before starting their final year.[^3] This check only takes place after course registration in order for advisors to verify requirements with the specific courses enrolled rather than a hypothetical list.
